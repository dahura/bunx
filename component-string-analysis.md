# Component String Representation Analysis

## Problem Statement

The issue is that the current string-based event handler extraction in the renderer doesn't work properly with complex nested JSX structures like the Counter component. The Greetings component works because it's simple, but the Counter component has nested elements without IDs.

## Current Approach Issues

1. The `extractEventHandlersFromString` function uses a simple regex that doesn't handle nested structures well
2. Elements without IDs can't be targeted by the client-side script
3. The regex pattern is not sophisticated enough to handle complex JSX structures

## What We Need to Do

1. Parse the string representation of the component to identify elements with event handlers
2. For elements that don't have IDs, generate and inject IDs into the string
3. Extract event handlers along with their associated element IDs
4. Generate client-side scripts that can target these elements

## Expected String Structure

For the Counter component, we would expect a string representation that looks something like:

```
jsx('div', {className: "p-4 max-w-md mx-auto border rounded shadow", children: [
  jsx('h1', {className: "text-2xl mb-4", children: "Счётчик: 0"}),
  jsx('div', {className: "flex gap-2", children: [
    jsx('button', {className: "bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded", onClick: () => count--}, "–"),
    jsx('button', {onClick: () => alert("Hello world!"), className: "bg-green-500 hover:bg-greenx-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"}, "+")
  ]})
]})
```

## Solution Approach

1. Parse the string to identify JSX elements with event handlers
2. For elements with event handlers but no ID, generate and inject an ID
3. Extract the event handlers with their element IDs
4. Generate appropriate client-side JavaScript

## Key Challenges

1. Properly parsing nested JSX structures from string representation
2. Injecting IDs without breaking the component structure
3. Handling multiple event handlers on the same element
4. Ensuring the modified string is still valid for rendering
